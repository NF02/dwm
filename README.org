* DWM - Dynamic Window Manager
DWM is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


** Requirements
In orde to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


** Installation
Edit *config.mk* to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if necessary as root):
#+begin_src bash
make clean install
#+end_src

** Running DWM
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:
#+begin_src bash
exec dwm
#+end_src
In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:
#+begin_src bash
DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm
#+end_src
(This will start dwm on display *:1* of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:
#+begin_src bash
    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm
#+end_src

** Configuration
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.

*** Short config
To add new shortcuts, you need to edit the file located in *lib/commend.h*, adding a constant string with the following
constant:
#+begin_src c
  ...
  static const char *Namecmd[] = {"command", NULL};
  ...
#+end_src
The command must be one of the reference shell, typically /*bash or zsh*/, so we can use all the programs that can be summoned
from the terminal.

*** X11 Special key
The library located in lib/keyWorld.h introduces the i3wm key nomenclature quickly and easily.
